            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS this unnaturall Rebellion was begun and fomented upon pretence of maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true Protestant Religion, the Laws, Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament; And was heretofore carryed on in the name of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon pretence also of the preservation of Our Honour, and the Rights of Our Crowne, and the Safety of Our Person, and redeeming it from the hands and power of evill Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors: And under these specious pretences very many of Our Subjects have been misled into it. But that which was at first known and foreseen by some, may now be manifest to all, even of the meanest capacity, that these were but pretences to colour the Ambition, malice, and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of a few men; since it is apparent, that in the prosecution, and for the upholding of the Rebellion, there hath been more prophanation and scorne to the Protestant Religion here established, more oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Subject, by depriving them of their Lives, Liberty and Property, without and against Law, and more usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon the Rights of Our Crowne, and violation of Lawes, and of Acts of Parliament, and of Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament publiquely avowed, then can be parallell'd by any former example in this Kingdom. And upon Our severall Messages and Invitations for a Treaty for Peace, nothing is propounded to Us, and insisted upon, concerning the breach of any Law, or the Liberty, or Property of the Subject, or the Priviledges of Parliament; But changes in the Religion established, and alterations of the ancient Government of this Kingdome both in Church and State. And touching the defence and safety of Our Person, notwithstanding Our earnest endeavours for Peace, this Rebellion is still prosecuted, and new Armies now moulded, and Forces raised under the name of the Parliament and State, with Commission to kill and destroy, without exception or regard of Our Person: So that (beside the Tryalls We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready undergone) We may easily discerne what safety or defence We are to expect hereafter. And it is evident that the designe tends to the destruction, not onely of Our Person and Posterity, but even of Monarchy it selfe: and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the true Protestant Religion established, of the Lawes, Liberty and Property of the Subject, of the just Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament, and of Our Person, and the Rights of Our Crowne, are laid aside, and can be no longer preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for this Rebellion. And whereas We have reason to beleeve that very many of Our Subjects, who were heretofore seduced, and misled, are by this, and their own manifold sufferings, brought to a sight of their error, and to a dislike and detestation of this execrable Rebellion, which threatens speedy Ruine and destruction to the Nation: but being hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore involved and intangled in the guilt of it, are doubtfull of their owne security, and cannot easily find the way to free themselves with safety. In pursuance therefore of Our constant purpose, to omit nothing which We shall conceive may give security to those Our Subjects, who shall not still wilfully and malitiously persist in mischiefe, and which may conduce to the quenching of this Fire, and restoring Peace to Our People in all Our Dominions, We have thought fit once againe to set forth this Our Proclamation of Grace and Pardon: And We doe hereby Publish and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That to all such of what estate, degree, or condition soever they be (without exception) who shall before the end of <hi>May</hi> next ensuing, returne to their due Obedience, and submit to, and desire Our Mercy, We shall grant them Our free and gracious Pardon for all offences whatsoever, committed or done, in or by the prosecuting, promoting, assisting, or countenancing of this Rebellion, or which have any relation thereunto. And this in the Word of a King We shall effectually make good unto them.</p>
